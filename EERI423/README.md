# Wellcome to my EERI423 Notes

All relevant notes are in PDF format, the other files are LaTex Source code, where applicable

## Flash cards
The flash cards are a mess. So far I was able to find the flash cards I used in ST1 and 2, but they are unwiledy and even so lack some info. Please let me know if you're interested in contirbuting

## Past papers, breakdowns
The past papers seem to have been set by prof. holm, but apparently old papers are wothwile, according to the lecturer. The breakdown lists the basic themes touched by each paper since 2013

## List of block diagrams
I set up the wiki of this repo so that anyine with a github account can edit it.I'll try to add all the block diagrams there, but we can use it as a simple pastebin or issue tracker over the next few days.
